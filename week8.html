  <h2> Sewing </h2>
<p>This week we learned how to use the Viking Emerald sewing machine, how to sew, and how to sew our own pants. I learned that the process to sew clothes takes very long and there is a lot of things that you can mess up on while sewing.</p>
<p>I made my own pants with the alien/ufo fabric. We used a bunch of pins and different sewing techniques/settings to make the pants, such as cutting a bit of the round pieces of fabric to make sewing along the curve easier. I think the biggest challenge was making sure not to mess up while sewing, as I did that once and had to spend around 15 minutes fixing my mistake and cutting string and resewing.</p>
