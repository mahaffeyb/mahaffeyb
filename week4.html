<h1> Brian Mahaffey | WRA Digital Fab 2019 Week 4</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>This week we learned about the additive vs subtractive vs. formative processes in 3D printing and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each are. 
<p>The MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers are limited by the space they can use (due to them being quite small) therefore all objects must be within the constraints, the height being limited to around 5 inches and the width to around 10. The printers use additive manafacturing, which means they start from nothing and slowly build up items with concentrated building. This can be considered advantageous to the Formlabs printer as it allows for supports to be constructed and is in general more precise and has more freedom with what it can make.
  <h2> King Brian </h2>
<p>To make this I used a tablet to scan my face in real life and create an stl file. I then got a crown file off of thingiverse and combined the two with some simple moving of the objects.</p>

  <h2> Dice </h2>
<p>Was thinking of a simple object that couldn't be made with subtractive manafacturing and decided on a dice (subtractive wouldn't be able to reach all the holes). Made it simply by creating a cube and adding a couple small holes then smoothing the edges.

  <h2> Caesar Pencil Holder </h2>
<p>Julius Caesar Pencil Holder. Got inspiration for this when I saw a similar design while browsing an office supply website. For the body I used a human file I found off of thingiverse and cropped it a little. I then used one of the tools to create a grid of holes. I filled up the holes on the front side with the brush tool and then smoothed out the sculpture a bit. Most of the holes can hold a pencil but some struggle with it.</p>
