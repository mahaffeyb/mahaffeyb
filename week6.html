<h1> Brian Mahaffey | WRA Digital Fab 2019 Week 6</h1>

<br>
  <h2>Soldering</h2>
<p>I learned a lot this week. I learned the difference between AC and DC current (Alternating vs Direct) and the important of the difference. I learned what capacitors, transistors and resistors are and what polarized vs unpolarized means (If the direction you place them matters). I learned about voltage, current and resistance as well. Then of course I learned how to solder properly and what soldering does (Connects the circuit)</p>
<br>
 <br>
<p>Two projects are below, being the LED heart and the basic LED circuit (battery not included in picture),
