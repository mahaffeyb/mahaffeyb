  <h2>Soldering</h2>
<p>I learned a lot this week. I learned the difference between AC and DC current (Alternating vs Direct) and the important of the difference, for example AC being used for most wall power as you can have low power travelling through it then jump up to high power when something is plugged in as appose to DC which would just use a constant stream of energy which would waste money. I learned what capacitors, transistors and resistors are and what polarized vs unpolarized means (If the direction you place stuff on a circuit matters). I learned about voltage, current and resistance as well. Then of course I learned how to solder properly and what soldering does (Connects the circuit via hot liquid metal that cools quickly in order to conduct electricity throughout the circuit)</p>

<p>Two projects are below, being the LED heart and the basic LED circuit (battery not included in picture)</p>
