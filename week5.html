  <h2>Longboard</h2>
<p>Wanted to make a longboard that used one of my favourite paintings, The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Unfortunately it came out a little stretched, but I didn't want to waste a bunch of sticker paper by making it again.</p>
<br>
<p>To make the sticker I simply followed the instructions for making an EPS file sticker and printed it out. The wave and check emojis on the front side are from an old meme called "wave check" where people used said emojis while showing off their new hair style. I spray painted the front side white to match the colour of the waves on the back.</p>
