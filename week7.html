  <h2> Arduino Practice Projects </h2>
<p>This week we began working with learning what an Arduino is, how they work, and what their purpose is. We practice making a bunch of different circuits on an ardunio uno.</p>
<p>An Arduino is essentially a "microcontroller platform that is easy to use for electronics projects" as you do not have to solder and can easily attach wires and other modules.</p>
