  <h2> Gerby's Dream Land : Theatre Edition</h2>
<p>For my final project I decided to make a "Gerby" puppet theatre. It would consist of a moving conveyer belt that would move a 3d printed gerby (Mr. Gerber's face attached to a Kirby model) and play kirby music in the background via 2 arduinos. The actual theatre would just be some basic wood and cardboard.</p>
<p>I used spray-painted wood, lanyard material, cardboard, hot glue, an arduino + arduino wave shield, pvc pipe, and sticker paper</p>
<p>I spent probably around 9 hours working on my final project. I spent 2 days after school working on soldering and programming (from 3-6pm) and then about 1-2 hours each day when I came home after that</p>
<p>The machines I used were the the saw chopper (pvc/wood), sander (wood), laser cutter (wood/cardboard), roland printer (sticker), and hot glue gun (stick pieces together)
<p>I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to program an arduino wave shield to play compressed .wav files and I learned how to make a model conveyer belt. I learned that sometimes things don't work how you expect them too and I learned that circuits and program can be very frustrating when you don't know what's wrong</p>

<p>I began with a plan on how to make the project. I made measurements (changed some of them when making the actual theatre as some were a little off/too small), showed how the theatre would be put together, and how everything would work. I felt frustrated when I spent so much time on programming and on the project only to not have it work but if I had more time I think I could make it work. I never got around to 3d printing  the Gerby as I wanted to make sure the electronics worked first.</p>
<br>
<p>For the conveyer belt I cut two pieces of pvc around 5cm long and with a 2cm radius. I then attached 3cm cardboard circles to each side, stuck an iron 8 cm iron rod through them and hot glued everything together. I then cut out the pieces of cardboard in order to put it together, being 1 17.5cm x 5.5cm piece and 2 25cm x 2cm pieces. I made the other cylinder spray painted everything green then hot glued everything together and attached the black lanyard. The conveyer belt works if you hand crank it but I was unable to attach it to the servo motor as the rod was too big :-(  (worked on the conveyer belt at home so I couldn't see if it fit until I came to school)</p>

  <p>For the conveyer belt's servo motor I simply follow the arduino basic circuits book you gave us and made the circuit.</p>
<br>
<p>For the cardboard and wood pieces I used an x-acto knife and the lasercutter to get the correct measurements for the pieces. I spray painted the wood gold and spray painted some of the cardboard green (to make it look like grass)

 <p> For the Kirby music I follow instructions online at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-wave-shield-audio-shield-for-arduino?view=all#download in order to put the wave shield together, convert the .wav file to the correct format, and play the music. I borrowed Mrs. Fritz's SD card and SD card reader. The music was shown to be playing but the headphone jack didn't work for some reason. If you put the end of the earbuds up to pin 3 you could just barely hear the music (kirby green greens theme)</p>
<br>
<p>For the stickers I simply followed the instructions on the fab website to make stickers. For the background I pasted a background image of whispy woods (a kirby stage from the videogame) into CorelDraw and also used my old gerby super star sticker I made in one of the earlier weeks. </p>

<p>Overall I am pretty happy on how the project turned out. I wish I had more time to fix the electronics, make the theatre look better and add details, add fake grass foliage, 3d print Gerby and add lights. I had a lot of fun with my project and this class.</p>
