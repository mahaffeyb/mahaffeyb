<p>For my final project I decided to make a "Gerby" puppet theatre. It would consist of a moving conveyer belt that would move a 3d printed gerby (Mr. Gerber's face attached to a Kirby model) and play kirby music in the background via 2 arduinos. The actual theatre would just be some basic wood and cardboard.</p>
<p>I used spray-painted wood, lanyard material, cardboard, hot glue, an arduino + arduino wave shield, pvc pipe, and sticker paper</p>
<p>I spent probably around 9 hours working on my final project. I spent 2 days after school working on soldering and programming (from 3-6pm) and then about 1-2 hours each day when I came home after that</p>
<p>The machines I used were the the saw chopper (pvc), sander (wood), laser cutter (wood/cardboard), soldering iron (circuit), roland printer (sticker), and hot glue gun (stick pieces together)
<p>I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to program an arduino wave shield to play compressed .wav files and I learned how to make a model conveyer belt. I learned that sometimes things don't work how you expect them too and I learned that circuits and program can be very frustrating when you don't know what's wrong</p>
